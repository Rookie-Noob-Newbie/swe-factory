During its life it can be in one of four states: `ready`, `reserved`, `delayed`, or `buried`. After the `put` command, a job typically starts out ready. It waits in the ready queue until a worker comes along and runs the \"reserve\" command. If this job is next in the queue, it will be reserved for the worker. The worker will execute the job; when it is finished the worker will send a `delete` command to delete the job.\n \n | Status              | Description   |\n | --------------------| ------------- |\n-| `ready`             | it waits in the ready queue until a worker comes along and runs the \"reserve\" command |\n+| `ready`             | waiting to be reserved and processed after being put onto a tubed |\n | `reserved`          | if this job is next in the queue, it will be reserved for the worker.
