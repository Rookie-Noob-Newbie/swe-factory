  "guidance_for_write_eval_script_agent": "The eval script has several issues: 1) It assumes specific test files (heap-test.c, job-test.c, integ-test.c, util-test.c) instead of using the target test files specified by the user, but no test files were provided. 2) The compilation approach is complex and may conflict with the existing build system. 3) The script tries to compile ct/ct.o and ct/_ctcheck.c but ct/ct.c might not exist or need to be generated. 4) The object file collection assumes all .o files are in root directory, but they might be in a build directory. Please modify the script to: a) Wait for clarification on which test files to run, b) Use a simpler approach by leveraging the existing Makefile system with 'make check' or modifying which tests are built, c) Properly handle the test runner generation as per the repository's build system.",
  "guidance_for_context_retrieval_agent": "We need the following information from the target repository at commit f43a5470128a1f94210dace36244503148c1f42f: 1) What are the actual test files that should be run? 2) Examine the Makefile to understand the test building process, especially the 'check' target and ct/gen script usage. 3) Look for any dependencies in README.md, INSTALL, or docs/ that might be missing from the Dockerfile. 4) Check if there's a .travis.yml, .github/workflows/, or any CI configuration that shows how tests are typically run. 5) Look for any test-specific requirements or environment variables needed. 6) Check the structure of the ct/ directory to understand the test framework. Original issue: The evaluation script assumes specific test files but none were provided, and the manual compilation approach may not match the repository's actual build system."
