+A job in beanstalk gets created by a client with the `put` command. During its life it can be in one of four states: `ready`, `reserved`, `delayed`, or `buried`. After the `put` command, a job typically starts out ready. It waits in the ready queue until a worker comes along and runs the "reserve" command. If this job is next in the queue, it will be reserved for the worker. The worker will execute the job; when it is finished the worker will send a `delete` command to delete the job.
