This information will be used by other agent.\n   - Otherwise, set `\"terminate\": false` and provide all collected details.\n\nAPI List:\n\n- browse_folder(path: str, depth: str): Browse and return the folder structure for a given path in the repository.  The depth is a string representing a number of folder levels to include in the output such as ``1''. \n- browse_file_for_environment_info(file_path: str, custom_query: str): Call an agent to browse a file such as README or CONTRIBUTING.md and extract environment setup and running tests information. Use the `custom_query` parameter to tell the agent any extra details it should pay special attention to (for example, 'pom.xml dependency versions').\n- search_files_by_keyword(keyword: str): Search for files in the repository whose names contain the given keyword.\n\n### **IMPORTANT RULES**:\n- **Extract all relevant API calls from the text**:\n  - If files like `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py` are mentioned, call `browse_file_for_environment_info()` on them.\n  - If a directory needs exploration, use `browse_folder()`, ensuring `depth` defaults to `\"1\"` if unspecified.\n- If the API call includes a path, the default format should use Linux-style with forward slashes (/).\n- Ensure all API calls are valid Python expressions.\n- browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path.to.file\") should be written as browse_file_for_environment_info(\"path/to/file\")\n- the browse_folder API call MUST include the depth parameter, defaulting to \"1\" if not provided.\n- You MUST ignore the argument placeholders in API calls. For example:\n    Invalid Example: browse_folder(path=\"src\", depth=1) \n    Valid Example: browse_folder(\"src\",1)\n- Provide your answer in JSON structure like this:\n{\n    \"API_calls\": [\"api_call_1(args)\", \"api_call_2(args)\", ...],\n    \"collected_information\": <Content of collected information>.\n    \"terminate\": true/false\n}\n\n"

The information I have so far (just the root directory structure) is **not sufficient** to satisfy these requirements. I need to gather concrete information to answer each point.\n\nI will now execute a series of targeted API calls to collect the precise information requested.\n\n### Proposed API Calls:\n\n1.  **Browse the `ct/` directory** to understand the test framework and identify actual test files.\n2.  **Examine the `Makefile`** to understand the test building process, especially the 'check' target and ct/gen script usage.\n3.  **Browse `README`** and `doc/` for dependencies and setup instructions.\n4.  **Search for CI configuration files** (e.g., `.travis.yml`, files in `.github/workflows/`).\n5.  **Check for any `INSTALL` file**.\n6.  **Examine `integ-test.c` and `job-test.c`** as they appear to be test files.\n\nLet's start.\n\n**API Calls:**\n```python\n# 1. Browse the ct/ directory to see its structure and identify test files/framework.\nbrowse_folder(path=\"ct\", depth=\"2\")\n\n# 2. Examine the Makefile for test building, 'check' target, and gen script usage.\nbrowse_file_for_environment_info(file_path=\"Makefile\", custom_query=\"What are the targets for building and running tests, especially 'check'? What does the ct/gen script do? Are there any special dependencies or flags for testing?\")\n\n# 3. Browse the README file for dependencies and setup instructions.\nbrowse_file_for_environment_info(file_path=\"README\", custom_query=\"What are the dependencies (libraries, tools, OS packages) required to build and run the project? Are there any specific test commands or instructions?\")\n\n# 4. Search for CI configuration files.\nsearch_files_by_keyword(\".yml\")\nsearch_files_by_keyword(\".travis\")\n# Also check for .github/workflows directory by browsing if it exists.\nbrowse_folder(path=\".github\", depth=\"1\")\n\n# 5. Check for an INSTALL file.\nsearch_files_by_keyword(\"INSTALL\")\n\n# 6. Briefly examine the integ-test.c and job-test.c to confirm they are test files.\nbrowse_file_for_environment_info(file_path=\"integ-test.c\", custom_query=\"Is this an integration test file?
